## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to offset background images from center from [this StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5981842/html-background-image-offset-by-x-pixels-from-the-center).

### Continued development

I underestimated the importance of forward planning, and ended up with a bunch of classes that did the same thing and needed to be consolidated.

### Useful resources
